# Contrastive learning of image- and structure based representations in drug discovery

Paper is available [here](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OdXKRtg1OG). 

This repository will contain the necessary code for reproducing the results shown in the paper. It consists in an application of [CLOOB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11316.pdf) and [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf) for drug discovery, using fluorescence microscopy images and molecular structures. It is based on the implementation of [CLOOB](https://github.com/ml-jku/cloob).
